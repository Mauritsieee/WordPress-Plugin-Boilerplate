
This is a boilerplate for a custom WordPress plugin, currently in its initial development phase. This framework provides the foundation to build upon and customize for your specific plugin needs.

## Setup Instructions

To get started with the plugin, follow these steps:

1. Download the root folder (named `custom-plugin`).
2. Rename the following files to reflect the new plugin name:
    - `custom-plugin` (root folder)
    - `custom-plugin.php`
3. Perform a "Find and Replace" across all files for the following terms:
    - `custom-plugin` → Replace with your new plugin name.
    - `CustomPlugin` → Replace with your new plugin's class name.

5. Set up version management to keep track of plugin versions.
6. Add functionality for script loading (e.g., JavaScript or CSS files).
7. Include detailed comments throughout the files for better code understanding and maintenance.
